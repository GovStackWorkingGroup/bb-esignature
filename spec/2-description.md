# 2 Description

e-Signature building block provides open digital signatures for everyone. This project will detail the APIs & standards that are necessary to support large-scale e-signatures.

e-Signature or an electronic signature is a way of signing documents digitally, without needing to print them. Itâ€™s sort of like an electronic version of a pen and paper signature or stamp, specific to a person or organization and is both secure and legally binding.

e-Signature building block works closely with Identity building block, to link cryptographic objects to a real person.
